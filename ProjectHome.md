Nethack is a single-player turn-based roguelike computer game.

Pynethack allows you to write bots that play nethack and attempt to survive in the dungeon.

You can run a local nethack game (you'll neet nethack installed at least) or you can run against a local dgamelaunch nethack server (check out http://www.advogato.org/proj/dgamelaunch/ ).
